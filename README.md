# TURTLEBOT LOCALIZATION AND NAVIGATION USING ROS!


The repository contains the work done as part of the Robotics module For master in computer vision and robotics " VIBOT", The Repository contains two different methods for autonomous  robots Localization and Navigation, [behavior_based](https://github.com/ElJAZRY/ROS_PROJECT/tree/master/behavior_based "behavior_based") and [map_based](https://github.com/ElJAZRY/ROS_PROJECT/tree/master/map_based "map_based") , the two methods represent different approaches to the problem of autonomous robots Localization and Navigation and a combination of both to get the benefits of both methods

Map based Vs Behavior-based navigation [1].


To Launch Map Based Navigation  :
```
roslaunch map_based.launch
 OR
python map_based/go_goal.py
```


To Launch Behavior Based Navigation  :
```
roslaunch behavior_based.launch
 OR
python map_based/wander.py
```
