# TURTLEBOT LOCALIZATION AND NAVIGATION USING ROS!


The repository contains the work done as part of the Robotics module For master in computer vision and robotics " VIBOT", The Repository contains two different methods for autonomous  robots Localization and Navigation, [behavior_based](https://github.com/ElJAZRY/ROS_PROJECT/tree/master/behavior_based "behavior_based") and [map_based](https://github.com/ElJAZRY/ROS_PROJECT/tree/master/map_based "map_based") , the two methods represent different approaches to the problem of autonomous robots Localization and Navigation and a combination of both to get the benefits of both methods
